== Preflight ==

* Ensure the server meets or exceeds the system requirements:
    https://textpattern.com/system-requirements

== Installation ==

* Extract the Textpattern files to your site (in the web root, subdomain or
  subdirectory). The top-level index.php file should reside in this directory,
  as should the /textpattern/, /files/, /images/, /rpc/ and /themes/
  directories.
* If you are running Textpattern on an Apache web server, ensure the top-level
  .htaccess file is transferred to your site. The file is hidden by default on
  some operating systems, including macOS. FTP clients and IDEs typically have
  an option to show these hidden files. You can show or hide hidden files in
  macOS Finder with the Cmd + Shift + . keyboard shortcut.
* Create or verify the existence of a working MySQL database with valid username
  and password. From Textpattern 4.6.0, the MySQL database user requires INDEX
  permissions in addition to pre-existing permissions.
* Load /textpattern/setup/ (or /subdirectory/textpattern/setup/) in your
  browser to start the installation process and follow the directions.
* When the installation is complete, remove the /textpattern/setup/ directory
  from your site.
* If you are running Textpattern on an Apache web server, you can rename
  /files/.htaccess-dist to /files/.htaccess to prohibit direct URL access to
  your uploaded files. Thus the only route to these files becomes through the
  /file_download/ directory. It is recommended you consider employing this
  feature. Alternatively, move your /files/ directory out of a web-accessible
  location. Once moved, you can specify your new directory location from the
  Textpattern Admin Preferences (Admin -> Preferences -> Admin).

== Upgrades ==

* Textpattern is actively developed. Updates are released to enhance & extend
  functionality, fix bugs and address security-related issues. It is recommended
  to periodically check for newer releases. Updates are engineered to be low
  friction and are accompanied by release notes indicating changes.
* The software version number is displayed on every admin-side page by default.
