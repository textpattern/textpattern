== Upgrading ==

* Simply replace the two files in your main installation directory 
  (index.php and .htaccess) and everything in your /textpattern/ 
  directory (except config.php) with the corresponding files in this
  distribution.
* When you login to the admin-side, the relevant upgrade script is 
  run automatically. Please take a look into diagnostics to find out 
  whether there are any errors and whether the correct version number 
  is displayed.
