### Anticipated changes to future system requirements

As a development version approaches release, minimum and recommended system requirements are confirmed and the production release system requirements is updated accordingly.

The following table outlines anticipated forthcoming changes to system requirements. It takes into account vendor support, security considerations, overall performance and other factors. Note that minimum and/or recommended versions listed may change multiple times during the development process.

#### Textpattern development versions

We are targeting Textpattern 5 as the next major release. Refer to the following table for anticipated changes to system requirements for Textpattern 5.

We generally recommend running Textpattern on platforms with active vendor support where possible, though we also maintain a minimum system requirements list for situations where that isn't viable.

Note that versions listed may change multiple times during the development process.

|        |  Minimum  | Recommended |
|--------|:-------:|:-----:|
| PHP    | &mdash; | [vendor supported](https://php.net/supported-versions.php) |
| MySQL  | &mdash; | [vendor supported LTS](https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html) |
| Apache | &mdash; | vendor supported |
| Nginx  | &mdash; | mainline or stable |
