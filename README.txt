== About ==

Textpattern CMS is a flexible, elegant and easy-to-use content management
system. Textpattern is both free and open source.


== Installation ==

* Extract the Textpattern files to your site (in the web root, subdomain or
  subdirectory). The top-level index.php file should reside in this directory,
  as should the /textpattern/ and /rpc/ directories.
* Ensure the top-level .htaccess file is transferred to your site. The file is
  hidden by default on some operating systems, including OS X/macOS. Most FTP
  clients and IDEs have an option to show these hidden files. Otherwise, you can
  temporarily show hidden files in OS X/macOS by using the Terminal.app - follow
  these instructions:
    http://textpattern.com/hidden-files-osx
* Create or verify the existence of a working MySQL database with valid username
  and password. From Textpattern 4.6.0, the MySQL database user requires INDEX
  permissions in addition to standard SELECT, CREATE, UPDATE, ALTER, etc
  permissions. See the system requirements for a complete list:
    http://textpattern.com/system-requirements
* Load /textpattern/setup/ (or /subdirectory/textpattern/setup/) in your
  browser to start the installation process and follow the directions.
* When the installation is complete, remove the /textpattern/setup/ directory
  from your site.


== Upgrading ==

* Confirm your web server meets or exceeds the Textpattern system requirements:
    http://textpattern.com/system-requirements
* Log out of the Textpattern admin-side.
* Verify the existence of a known-good Textpattern database and file backup.
* Ensure your MySQL database user has INDEX permissions in addition to any
  permissions previously granted.
* Replace the top-level index.php, css.php and .htaccess files, everything in
  the /rpc/ directory and everything in the /textpattern/ directory (except
  /textpattern/config.php) with the corresponding files in this distribution.
  When uploading the /textpattern/ directory, ensure you merge its contents with
  your existing site to preserve any custom files in your existing installation.
  Note: css.php and /rpc/ may not exist if the installed version of
  Textpattern is prior to 4.2.0.
* It is recommended that the browser cache is cleared to ensure the newer files
  are used in preference to the older files.
* Log in to the Textpattern admin-side. The upgrade script(s) will run
  automatically. Check the diagnostics (Admin -> Diagnostics) to confirm the
  correct Textpattern version number is displayed and whether there are any
  errors.
  NOTE: Upgrades from versions prior to 4.2.0 will present warnings or errors
  upon the first login to the admin-side. These may include:
    Unknown column 'user_name' in 'where clause' select name,
    val from txp_prefs where prefs_id=1 AND user_name='' in
    /path/to/your/site/textpattern/lib/txplib_db.php on line xx
    Undefined variable: language in
    /path/to/your/site/textpattern/index.php at line xx
    Undefined variable: gmtoffset in
    /path/to/your/site/textpattern/update/_to_4.2.0.php at line xx
  This is expected behaviour. The messages will disappear with subsequent
  navigation in the admin-side.
* Verify all preference settings (Admin -> Preferences).
* Remove the /textpattern/setup/ directory from your site.


== Getting Started ==

* The Textpattern FAQ is available at http://textpattern.com/faq/
* In-depth documentation and a comprehensive tag index is available in the
  Textpattern documentation at http://textpattern.net/
* You can get support and information via:
   Forum:    http://forum.textpattern.com/
   Twitter:  http://textpattern.com/@textpattern
   Google+:  http://textpattern.com/+
   Facebook: http://textpattern.com/facebook
* If you are running an Apache web server, rename the .htaccess-dist file
  in the /files/ directory to .htaccess to prohibit direct URL access to
  your files. Thus the only route to these files becomes through the
  /file_download/ directory. It is recommended you consider employing this
  feature. Alternatively, move your /files/ directory out of a web-accessible
  location. Once moved, you can tell Textpattern of your new directory location
  from the Advanced Preferences.
* There are additional resources for the default front-side theme, such as
  Sass preprocessor files, available at:
    http://textpattern.com/default-theme/tree/master/


== IMPORTANT ==

* Check back regularly at http://textpattern.com/ to see if updates are
  available. Updates are as painless as possible, often fixing important bugs
  and/or security-related issues.
