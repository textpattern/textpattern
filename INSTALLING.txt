== Installation ==

* Extract the Textpattern files to your site (in the web root, subdomain or
  subdirectory). The top-level index.php file should reside in this directory,
  as should the /textpattern/, /files/, /images/, /rpc/ and /themes/
  directories.
* If you are running Textpattern on an Apache web server, ensure the top-level
  .htaccess file is transferred to your site. The file is hidden by default on
  some operating systems, including macOS. FTP clients and IDEs typically have
  an option to show these hidden files. You can show or hide hidden files in
  macOS Finder with the Cmd + Shift + . keyboard shortcut.
* Create or verify the existence of a working MySQL database with valid username
  and password. From Textpattern 4.6.0, the MySQL database user requires INDEX
  permissions in addition to pre-existing permissions. Refer to the system
  requirements for a complete list:
    https://textpattern.com/system-requirements
* Load /textpattern/setup/ (or /subdirectory/textpattern/setup/) in your
  browser to start the installation process and follow the directions.
* When the installation is complete, remove the /textpattern/setup/ directory
  from your site.
* If you are running Textpattern on an Apache web server, you can rename
  /files/.htaccess-dist to /files/.htaccess to prohibit direct URL access to
  your uploaded files. Thus the only route to these files becomes through the
  /file_download/ directory. It is recommended you consider employing this
  feature. Alternatively, move your /files/ directory out of a web-accessible
  location. Once moved, you can specify your new directory location from the
  Textpattern Admin Preferences (Admin -> Preferences -> Admin).


== IMPORTANT ==

* Check back regularly at https://textpattern.com/ to see if an update is
  available. Updates are as painless as possible, often extending functionality,
  fixing bugs and/or security-related issues. Textpattern's diagnostics
  (Admin -> Diagnostics) will display a message if a new version is available.
