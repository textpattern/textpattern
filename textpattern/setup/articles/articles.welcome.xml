* Dive in and learn by doing? Please note:
** When you write an article you assign it to a "section":adminurl/index.php?event=section of your site.
** Sections use a "page":adminurl/index.php?event=page template and a "style":adminurl/index.php?event=css to define how site content appears in a browser.
** Page templates typically use HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and "Textpattern tags":https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/ (like this: @<txp:article />@) to build the output code.
** Some Textpattern tags use "forms":adminurl/index.php?event=form, reusable building blocks that provide extensive control and customization over your site construction.
** Pages, styles and forms can be packaged into "themes":adminurl/index.php?event=skin and assigned to one or more sections.

Textpattern tags, their attributes and values are explained within the "Textpattern User Documentation":https://docs.textpattern.com/, where you will also find valuable examples, advice and tutorials.

There's also a group of friendly, helpful Textpattern users and administrators at the "Textpattern support forum":https://forum.textpattern.com/.

Additional language translations and corrections are welcomed. Please visit "Textpattern language translations":https://textpattern.com/languages for further details.
