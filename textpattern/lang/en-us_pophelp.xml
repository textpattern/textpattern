        <item id="article_image" title="Article image"><![CDATA[
<h2>Article image</h2>
<p>To associate a single image with this article, place one of the following here:</p>
<ol>
    <li>a Textpattern image ID (e.g. <code>12</code>)</li>
    <li>a relative URL to the image (e.g. <code>/images/my_pic.jpg</code>)</li>
    <li>a fully-qualified URL (e.g. <code>https://example.com/path/to/images/my_pic.jpg</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The image can be displayed by placing a <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/article_image"><code>&lt;txp:article_image /&gt;</code> tag <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> inside an article form. It will output a complete HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to the chosen image.</p>

        <item id="body" title="Body"><![CDATA[
<h2>Body</h2>
<p>The main content of an article is contained within the article body.</p>
<p>When composing or preparing articles for publication in Textpattern, an author can switch between three views of the article: plain text, HTML markup (the code with which a web browser renders the article), and a rendered preview.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="description" title="Description"><![CDATA[
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The article description is an optional component that can help search engines and website crawlers better identify and sort content.</p>
<p>The article description is limited to a maximum of 255 characters. Note that some search engines place character limits on the length of a page’s <code>meta description</code> for practicality of display in search engine results pages (SERPs) and this may be less than the 255 character limit in Textpattern.</p>
<p>Note that the article description differs from the article excerpt, though they both accept similar content. The article description should be primarily intended for use with search engines and crawlers, whereas the the article excerpt is more suited for a human-readable article summary where desired.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="excerpt" title="Excerpt"><![CDATA[
<h2>Excerpt</h2>
<p>Article excerpts are optional. Excerpts could be used as a short summary of the article that is displayed as part of a table of contents, used in place of the full article body in the site’s RSS/Atom feeds, or a number of other uses.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="expire_date" title="Expiration date"><![CDATA[
<h2>Expiration date</h2>
<p>The time an article is labelled as expired. The time is optional and can be set to an arbitrary time in the past or future.</p>
<p>The boxes correspond to the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Year / Month / Day</li>
    <li>Hour (24-hour format) : Minute : Second</li>
</ul>
<p>When the time arrives, or in the case where a time in the past is provided, the article expires.</p>
<p>If the option to display expired articles is enabled, the article remains visible. If the option to display expired articles is disabled, visitors to the article page will be served an HTTP 410 error in place of the article content.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="keywords" title="Keywords"><![CDATA[
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>Keywords are useful for refining the relationships between articles beyond those provided by categories.</p>
<p>Keywords must be individual words separated by commas.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="override_form" title="Override form"><![CDATA[
<h2>Override form</h2>
<p>An article can optionally use a form different from that assigned by default - for example to show an article excerpt with <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/excerpt"><code>&lt;txp:excerpt /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> instead of the article body with <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/body"><code>&lt;txp:body /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> - this can be set here.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="publish_date" title="Publish date"><![CDATA[
<h2>Publish date</h2>
<p>The time an article or file is published or most-recently revised. The time can be set to the moment the item is published, or to an arbitrary time in the past or future.</p>
<p>The boxes correspond to the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Year / Month / Day</li>
    <li>Hour (24-hour format) : Minute : Second</li>
</ul>
<p>An item with a timestamp greater than the current time (i.e. in the future) will not appear on the front side and the RSS/Atom feeds until that time arrives.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="status" title="Status"><![CDATA[
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Defines the publishing visibility status of this Textpattern article.</p>
<p>The publishing status is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Draft</li>
    <li>Hidden</li>
    <li>Pending</li>
    <li>Live</li>
    <li>Sticky</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>draft</strong> article is considered a work-in-progress and is not viewable outside of the Textpattern administration area (i.e. not visible on the Textpattern front side and not syndicated in feeds).</p>
<p>A <strong>hidden</strong> article is not viewable outside of the Textpattern administration area.</p>
<p>A <strong>pending</strong> article is considered ready for publication and awaiting approval, but is not viewable outside of the Textpattern administration area.</p>
<p>A <strong>live</strong> article is typically viewable outside the Textpattern administration area (i.e. visible on the Textpattern front side, syndicated in feeds if the preference permits). If an article is live and has an expiration date, the status will remain as live after that date has been reached, but the article only appears outside the administration area if expired articles are permitted to be published.</p>
<p>A <strong>sticky</strong> article is similar to a <strong>live</strong> article insofar as it can be viewed outside the Textpattern administration area but will <strong>not</strong> appear in article lists unless the respective <code>article</code> or <code>article_custom</code> tag includes a <code>status</code> attribute with a <code>sticky</code> value.</p>

<h2>URL-only title</h2>
<p>To use a specific title in to the permalink URL for an article, enter it here. If it is left blank, the URL title will be automatically generated from the article title.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful if the title of the article uses non-ASCII characters.</p>

    <group id="category" title="Categories panel">
        <item id="article_category" title="Articles"><![CDATA[
<h2>Articles</h2>
<p>Unlike sections, which define the navigational structure of a site, article categories allow organization of articles by their subject matter. Once categories are assigned, lists of articles belonging to particular categories can be browsed.</p>
<p>For example, likely article categories on a site about food might be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>raw ingredients</li>
    <li>shopping</li>
    <li>recipes</li>
    <li>presentation</li>
    <li>restaurants</li>
    <li>chefs</li>
</ul>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="category_description" title="Description"><![CDATA[
<h2>Category description</h2>
<p>The category description is an optional component that can help search engines and website crawlers better identify and sort content.</p>
<p>The category description is limited to a maximum of 255 characters. Note that some search engines place character limits on the length of a page’s <code>meta description</code> for practicality of display in search engine results pages (SERPs) and this may be less than the 255 character limit in Textpattern.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="file_category" title="Files"><![CDATA[
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>File categories are optional, and useful for grouping selected uploaded files together.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="image_category" title="Images"><![CDATA[
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Image categories are optional, and useful both for internal organization and for defining image sets that can be displayed using the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/image_index"><code>&lt;txp:image_index /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> and <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/image_display"><code>&lt;txp:image_display /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> tags.</p>
        ]]></item>
        <item id="link_category" title="Links"><![CDATA[
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Link categories are optional, and are useful for displaying different groupings of links, e.g. ‘Friends’, ‘Romans’, ‘Countrymen’.</p>
<p>Selective link lists such as these are output with the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/linklist"><code>&lt;txp:linklist /&gt;</code> tag <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;txp:linklist category="Friends" /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.</code></pre>

<h2>Clean URL data failed</h2>
<p>It appears that either the site URLs (e.g. <code>https://example.com/section/article</code>) are currently not working or the web server does not support the test procedure to determine if clean URLs work or not; if clean URLs on the site work as expected, this message can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>If clean URLs are <em>not</em> working it may mean either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the ‘Site URL’ setting is incorrect, or the page at that address is not managed by this instance of Textpattern</li>
    <li>the server requires some changes to <code>.htaccess</code> or similar server directive in order to make clean URLs work</li>
    <li>the server doesn’t support clean URLs at all</li>
</ul>
<p>The clean URL test attempts to fetch a page from the web address specified in the ‘Site URL’ preference in order to check that all clean URL parameters are working correctly. If that URL is a different site, or has been replaced with a static page or similar, the test will fail. Until the issue is resolved messy URLs (e.g. <code>https://example.com?s=section&amp;id=4</code>) should be used. Ensure the ‘Permanent link mode’ in Admin Preferences is set accordingly.</p>
<p>Note that using a plugin to put a site in ‘maintenance mode’ may trigger this warning.</p>

<h2>Textpattern version update</h2>
<p>There is a newer version of Textpattern available. To take advantage of the latest features and security, it is recommended you upgrade.</p>
<p>Please note that while we strive to make the upgrade experience as seamless and pain-free as possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If only the last digit differs from your current version, the upgrade is likely to be backwards compatible with plugins and themes.</li>
    <li>If the last two digits differ from your current version, the upgrade might require updates to some plugins and/or themes, although it will probably continue to work anyway in a limited capacity.</li>
    <li>If the first digit is different from your current version, the upgrade is likely to require updates to most plugins and themes. If you rely heavily on a particular plugin or theme feature, please check with the author or community members before commencing the upgrade.</li>

<h2>Textpattern pre-release update available</h2>
<p>There is a newer pre-release version of Textpattern available. We are looking for active volunteers to test this version so we can make the final release as solid as possible. We strive to make the upgrade experience seamless and pain-free, even for beta code.</p>
<p>Should you decide to participate, please note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do not use this beta release on a production site unless you have a working backup of both the site's files and its database, and know how to use it.</li>
    <li>Please <a href="https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/issues">report any issues</a>, stating the beta version that you are using. Further beta releases may be required prior to the stable release, depending on issues reported.</li>
    <li>Ensure that if you deploy this beta release, you also update to the final version when it is released.</li>

        <item id="forms_overview" title="Introduction to Forms"><![CDATA[
<h2>Introduction to Forms</h2>
<p>In Textpattern, a form is a snippet or chunk of text, HTML, and Textpattern tags that can be reused to display content.</p>
<p>Here’s an example form which could be named <code>ordinary_list</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;txp:permlink&gt;
        &lt;txp:title /&gt;
    &lt;/txp:permlink&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You could use it to display an HTML unordered list of related articles:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;txp:related_articles form="ordinary_list" wraptag="ul" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Since the role of this form is to output a list of titles, it could be applicable inside other tags, such as showing 20 articles from the current section:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;txp:article form="ordinary_list" limit="20" wraptag="ol" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You may also choose to employ a form to display repeated content, such as header and footer in your page templates. This means the content only exists in one place and if you decide to change it, you only need to do it once. Displaying content from a form is usually accomplished with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;txp:output_form form="your_form_name" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>A form can be up to 64KB in size. An example for a footer might include headings, paragraphs, links, conditional tags, and references to other forms such as <code>ordinary_list</code>.</p>

        <item id="custom_form_types" title="Custom form template types"><![CDATA[
<h2>Custom form template types</h2>
<p>In addition to the standard form template types (article, file, misc, etc.), Publishers can define custom types. The purpose of custom form template types is twofold: easier form template classification and custom asset definitions.</p>
<p>The format of the preference is <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a>, with each section corresponding to a form template type.</p>
<p>To define a custom form type (e.g. <code>js</code>) one must append (on a separate line) a <code>[js]</code> section. A default title can be set via a <code>title="Javascript"</code> entry in the corresponding section. If needed, localized titles can be appended too (e.g. <code>ru="Скрипт"</code>).</p>
<p>Additionally, a form template <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">media type <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> (formerly known as a MIME type) can be specified, e.g. <code>mediatype="application/javascript"</code>. This turns form templates of this type into custom assets that can be served as the set media type, either from the database or from disk (flat files) via the <code>&lt;txp:output_form /&gt;</code> tag. For example, a form template named <code>myscript.js</code> of <code>[js]</code> type with a media type of <code>application/javascript</code> can be included in your code like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;txp:output_form form="myscript.js"
    format="flat.script" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This will generate the following HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag:<p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="path/to/flat/myscript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Only form templates with the name extension corresponding to their type (e.g. <code>myscript.js</code>) can be served as flat files. In this case, they will not be processed by Textpattern at all and are accessible via their URL.</p>
If a form template needs processing (if it contains Textpattern tags), you must serve it from the database. In this case you shouldn’t add the extension to the form name - call it just <code>myscript</code> (without <code>.js</code>) to make it inaccessible via a standard URL - and include it like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;txp::myscript format="script" /&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Custom fields</h2>

<p>You may name the fields in any manner you wish, but be aware of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using spaces improves legibility on the Write panel, but the fields may then <em>not</em> be used as sorting or filtering parameters in an article_custom tag. Consider underscores instead if you wish to use this functionality.</li>
<li>Be careful when naming fields that they do not clash with reserved field names in Textpattern. For example, do not use <code>title</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>limit</code>, <code>status</code>, etc as you will obtain strange results or broken sites.</li>
<li>Data in each field is limited to 255 characters of text only.</li>

<p>A <strong>live</strong> article is typically viewable outside the Textpattern administration area (i.e. visible on the Textpattern front side, syndicated in feeds if the preference permits). If an article is live and has an expiration date, the status will remain as live after that date has been reached, but the article only appears outside the administration area if expired articles are permitted to be published.</p>
<p>A <strong>sticky</strong> article is similar to a <strong>live</strong> article insofar as it can be viewed outside the Textpattern administration area but will <strong>not</strong> appear in article lists unless the respective <code>article</code> or <code>article_custom</code> tag includes a <code>status</code> attribute with a <code>sticky</code> value.</p>

        <item id="enable_short_tags" title="Enable short tag support?"><![CDATA[
<h2>Enable short tag support?</h2>
<p>Textpattern tags take the form <code>&lt;txp:tag_name attribute1="value" ... /&gt;</code>. It is possible to reduce the amount of typing involved by enabling a shorthand notation whereby the <code>txp:</code> may be omitted by following a few simple guidelines. Here are some examples to demonstrate the concept:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>&lt;txp:article_id /&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;article::id /&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;txp:recent_articles/&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;recent::articles /&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;txp:file_download_list /&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;file::download_list /&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;txp:smd_if /&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;smd::if /&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;txp:smd_if&gt; ... &lt;txp:else /&gt; ... &lt;/txp:smd_if&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;smd::if&gt; ... &lt;smd::else /&gt; ... &lt;/smd::if&gt;</code> (note that the plugin prefix can be used for the <code>else</code> tag).</li>
</ul>
<p>If a tag contains an underscore and you enable short tags, the basic concept is:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the <code>txp:</code> prefix.</li>
    <li>Replace the first occurrence of the underscore for <code>::</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that setting this preference does not affect the ability to use <code>&lt;txp:output_form /&gt;</code> short codes to render form snippets. You can still use <code>&lt;txp::shortcode /&gt;</code>, which will be interpreted as <code>&lt;txp:output_form form="shortcode" /&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Take the following example article title: <em>Ann and Bob eat cake</em></p>
<p>When permalink title URL pattern option is set to ‘Hyphenated (title-like-this)’, the URL for the article would be:</p>
<pre><code>https://example.com/ann-and-bob-eat-cake</code></pre>
<p>When permalink title URL pattern option is set to ‘Intercapped (TitleLikeThis)’, the URL for the article would be:</p>

<p>‘?=messy’ mode is the most compatible - it will work with little to no configuration required - but least beneficial in terms of URL readability and search engine optimization (SEO). In this mode URLs for articles on your site would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://example.com/index.php?id=123</code></pre>
<p>All other modes require the web server’s URL rewrite functionality (e.g. Apache <code>mod_rewrite</code> or NGINX rewrite directives in the <code>server</code> block). If your server does not support URL rewrite functionality either contact your web host or use the ‘?=messy’ mode outlined above.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you load plugins through the standard ‘Plugins’ panel on a production site, rather than using the plugin cache directory.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not specify the same directory for both ‘temporary’ and ‘plugin cache’, as this will cause problems (Textpattern would try to run the contents of temporary log files as plugins).</p>

<h3>Debugging mode</h3>
<p>All PHP error reporting on your live site will be visible, as will warnings about malfunctioning code and plugins. In addition, the following information will be visible when you view the HTML source of live pages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the time it took the server to build the page (‘Runtime’)</li>
    <li>the number of MySQL queries executed</li>
    <li>approximate peak memory usage</li>

        <item id="secondpass" title="Number of extra parser sweeps"><![CDATA[
<h2>Number of extra parser sweeps</h2>
<p>The Textpattern tag parser usually replaces all your tags with content from the database in one sweep of the page template. In some cases, this may be insufficient, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When using low load order plugins as tag attributes</li>
    <li>Code replacements inside <code>&lt;txp:php&gt;</code> tags</li>
    <li>Skipping page elements earlier in the page so they may receive content that is derived from a tag that is processed later</li>
</ul>
<p>Textpattern has traditionally run one extra sweep (called ‘secondpass’) for legacy reasons, hence the default value of this preference being <code>1</code>. More sweeps, however, increase the chances of unintended tags slipping through and being processed. Recent improvements in the tag parser have reduced the need for this second pass. So, unless you are using the second sweep for a dedicated reason, please reduce this value to <code>0</code> to make your site more secure.</p>
<p>If you subsequently find unprocessed tags being rendered on your website (and there are no other tag errors shown in Testing/Debugging modes due to mismatched tag pairs) then please contact us with your page template/code/plugin example. We are trying to eradicate the need for extra parser passes, and this information will help us achieve that.</p>

If nothing has changed since the visitor last loaded the page (i.e. if the timestamp the browser sends is the same as the last site update), then a header is sent back instructing the visitor’s browser to use its cached version of the page.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Sections in Textpattern are best thought of as analogous to sections in a newspaper; each belong to the same publication, but each might feature a different layout, or a different style of article, and so on.</p>
<p>For most websites, only a bare minimum of sections need be created.</p>
<h3>A likely scenario for a website with three sections:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Archive:</strong> The ‘Section’ to which all articles that appear on the front page belong. Whenever a reader clicks on an article’s permanent link, it will be displayed in the page layout assigned to this ‘Section’. To go to a paged list of the most recent articles assigned to the section "Archive", the URL would be <code>https://example.com/archive/</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>About:</strong> An ‘about this site’ page, which differs from the front page and the "Archive" section, in that it is more static, may have a different layout, and will likely contain only one article. The ‘About’ section would be reached at <code>https://example.com/about/</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> A ‘Section’ whose differing layout (and possibly different CSS) would display photos instead of articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that a special hidden section, named default, always exists. This default section uses the page named default and the style called default, and it constructs the front page of your site.</p>

<p>If most of your articles end up belonging to a particular section, select it from the list here. Changes will be reflected immediately.</p>
<p>You can override this on a per-article basis in the ‘Write’ panel by selecting a different section in the ‘Sort and display’ pane.</p>

        <item id="section_description" title="Description"><![CDATA[
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The section description is an optional component that can help search engines and website crawlers better identify and sort content.</p>
<p>The article description is limited to a maximum of 255 characters. Note that some search engines place character limits on the length of a page’s <code>meta description</code> for practicality of display in search engine results pages (SERPs) and this may be less than the 255 character limit in Textpattern.</p>

        <item id="section_on_frontpage" title="Section articles appear on front page?"><![CDATA[
<h2>Section articles appear on front page?</h2>
<p>The articles in some sections, such as those resembling more ‘static’ web pages, may seem out of place in the time-sensitive flow of your site’s front page.</p>
<p>Setting this to ‘No’ will prevent articles assigned to this section from appearing on the front page.</p>

<h2>Uses style</h2>
<p>If you wish to override the default stylesheet for a particular section, this can be set here.</p>

<h2>User login</h2>
<p>The login name of the administrator (‘Publisher’) account that you will use for administering of your site.</p>
<p>Although there are no restrictions on the name, it is best to avoid complicated character sequences and easily-guessed usernames (e.g. <code>admin</code>, <code>administrator</code>, etc.)</p>

        <item id="setup_user_pass" title="User password"><![CDATA[
<h2>User password</h2>
<p>Since this account has the highest level of access in Textpattern, choose a very strong password or, preferably, a passphrase.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase characters</li>
    <li>Use numbers</li>
    <li>Use symbols</li>
    <li>Make it at least eight characters in length</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid</strong> any personal information (dates, names, places, family members, pets, etc.)</li>

<h2>Table prefix</h2>
    <p>You only need to use a table prefix if you require multiple Textpattern installations in one database. Each Textpattern installation needs a unique prefix.</p>
    <p>Note that the prefix must adhere to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1st character:</strong> must be a-z, A-Z, or underscore</li>
    <li><strong>Subsequent characters:</strong> can only be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or underscore</li>

<h2>Import theme from disk</h2>
<p>This form allows you to import a theme into the Textpattern database from your themes directory.</p>
<p>An importable theme must be composed of a readable parent folder using the theme name as the folder name, and within the folder a readable <code>manifest.json</code> file in the expected format. The theme folder should also contain pages, forms and styles into eponym subfolders.</p>
<p>While pages and forms should use the <code>.txp</code> extension, stylesheets are expected to be <code>.css</code> files. Forms should also be grouped by type into dedicated directories. Textpattern will create any missing essential templates on import.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Themes</h2>
<p>A Textpattern theme is a collection of Pages, Forms and Stylesheets. Themes allow you to logically separate your site assets into groups for ease of identification, or sharing with others. The act of creating or importing a Theme, and any assets it contains, does <em>not</em> have any impact on your existing site. You are free to edit or modify any asset that is not associated with a Section of your site, and it will not affect the site itself.</p>
<p>To edit assets in a theme, visit the Pages, Forms or Styles panel and use the dropdown selector to choose the theme upon which you wish to work. The theme you are working on is remembered throughout the administration area, allowing you to jump between asset types quickly and easily. It is referred to as your <em>working theme</em>.</p>
<p>Please consult the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://docs.textpattern.com/build/themes-creating-using-and-sharing">Textpattern User Documentation <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> for further information.</p>
