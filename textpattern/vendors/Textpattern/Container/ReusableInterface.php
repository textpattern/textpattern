/**
 * Signals to the factory that the instance can be reused.
 *
 * Instances of this interface are treated as static. Once you initialise the
 * instance, it's kept and used again each time you reference the class using
 * the factory.
 *
 * For instance, the following will remember the initial value:
 *
 * <code>
 * class Abc_Class implements \Textpattern\Container\ReusableInterface
 * {
 *     public $random;
 *     public function __construct()
 *     {
 *         $this->random = rand();
 *     }
 * }
 * echo Txp::get('Abc_Class')->random;
 * echo Txp::get('Abc_Class')->random;
 * echo Txp::get('Abc_Class')->random;
 * </code>
 *
 * All three calls return the same Abc_Class::$random as the instance is kept
 * between calls.
 *
 * @since   4.6.0
