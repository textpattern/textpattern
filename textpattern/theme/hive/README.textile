h1. Hive admin-side theme (Classic Yellow) for Textpattern CMS

*Please note 1:* You'll need to be using the "latest GitHub development of Textpattern":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern in order to use this admin theme - we have done extensive work on improving the Textpattern admin-side code structure since v4.5 which directly relates to features used within this theme.

*Please note 2:* This theme is currently under development, and as such parts of the code are probably unfinished/unformated/untested/broken - please check the "GitHub project":https://github.com/philwareham/txp-hive-admin-theme/commits/master regularly for the latest revisions.

You are free to modify this theme, reuse code herein, and distribute all its supporting files as long as licences are respected (see below).
